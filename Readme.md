### ANSWER
- I did have fun with coding challenge you sent. It includes logics and knowledge of javascript DOM manipulation.
- I designed a website for you, you can check it by opening the index.html file in a browser.
- In js files, all codes in script.js and email.js belong to me(I did not use internet for them). I also added some jquery animations to the website using waypoints and more.
- There are filters, edit, add and remove button in the slider. By default, slider starts with autosliding with every 4 seconds. You can change it by typing any value in seconds.
- You can also use other buttons to see reaction.
- There is a checkbox. If you click it, slider won't start automatically on refresh(localstorage used for that).
- There is also a lazyloading. However, you can see external links after first three pictures. It will be more clear if you slide through those external pictures. Because, they are external links and need more time to be loaded(I copied some codes here from internet).
- I am waiting for comments. Anything that you would like me to add more, I would be adding new features.
